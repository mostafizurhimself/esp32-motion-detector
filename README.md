## ESP32 Motion Detector

This project is a simple motion detector using an ESP32 microcontroller and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it ideal for IoT projects. The PIR sensor detects motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation, which is emitted by objects in its field of view.
