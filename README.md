## ESP32 Motion Detector

This project is the implementation of a motion detector using an ESP32 microcontroller and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The ESP32 is programmed to detect motion and send the information to parent reciver using ESP-NOW protocol. The ESP-NOW protocol is a low-power, low-latency wireless communication protocol developed by Espressif for ESP32 devices.
The PIR sensor detects motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation in its environment. When motion is detected, the ESP32 sends a message to the parent receiver.

## Components Required

- ESP32 microcontroller
- PIR sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- Power supply (USB cable or battery)
